# python-environments (experimental)

This repo is public in order to make best use of GitHub Actions and Dependabot. 
Use at your own risk. 

It is (or may be in the future unless I drop the idea) collection of Python environments I use for some side-projects / tinkering purposes. 
Decided to have a dedicated repository for them in order to use Dependabot to keep my environments up to date without manual effort.
